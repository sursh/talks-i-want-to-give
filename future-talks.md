### Overcoming Open Source Anxiety

Have you always wanted to contribute to an open source project, but held back because your work didn’t seem quite right or quite ready? Open source contributions involve a lot of getting comfortable with the uncomfortable, but there are also some tips and tricks you can follow to make easing into the open source lifestyle a bit more comfortable. We’ll review reasons and methods for publishing your own open source work, and we’ll cover guidelines communities can follow to make sure established projects are as minimally anxiety-inducing as possible for contributors of all backgrounds.

### Measuring Continuous Learning
As technology evolves, we must evolve, and continually learn in order to keep up. We're *here today* to learn. We have easy access to information, but what metrics do we have for learning? Degrees? Certifications? GitHub profiles? Klout scores? Maybe you read Hacker News every day, but do you have anything to show for it?

We'll explore modern standards for continuous technical learning, including ways to measure and manage your own improvement. You'll walk away with a framework for better understanding your own learning and for encouraging continuous learning within your companies and teams.
