# Talks I've Given

## DevOps is an Attitude
* [SeaGL 2014](http://seagl.org/schedule/2014.html)

**Teaser:** If you’re trying to solve social or communication problems with technology … well, now you’ve got two problems. DevOps is often talked about in regards to tools, or what of the latest technology the kool kids are using. We’re going to talk about DevOps as an attitude and how thinking DevOps can change a culture of ugghhh into a culture of awesome.

**Description:** As Engineers, when we see something broken, we want to fix it. As technologists we tend to look to technology to solve problems, to make life easier and to avoid the need for human interaction.

DevOps isn’t a tool, it isn’t a specific set of technologies, there is no manifest to define it and it certainly isn’t a specific role or job title. This is about changing hearts and minds, removing the barriers (physical, organizational, and social) between business units.

There is no right way to do DevOps (but there certainly is wrong way!) getting the conversations happening that lead to formative change is the key. But what do you need to change? Can you change ingrained thought processes? Does DevOps even matter in a new team or company?

In this discussion we’ll talk about the buzz-worthy aspects of DevOps: Continuous Integration, Test/Behavior Driven Development, Monitoring, Measuring, Automation, and Feedback L
oops. But we’ll focus on the human factor, the communication channels and why this communication is important.

It’s not about the how, it’s about they why.


## Vagrant: Stop Wandering, Start Working!

* [NHPHP Meetup April 2014](http://www.meetup.com/NH-PHP/)
* [Fossetcon 2014](http://fossetcon.org/2014/featured-speaker)
* [SeaGL 2014](http://seagl.org/schedule/2014.html)

**Abstract**
An Introduction to using Vagrant to build configurable and portable development environments. Use easy to build and configureable development boxes to ease transitions between projects, test new libraries or patches, and make deployment to production easy, repeatable and boring (no more surprises or on-the-fly bug fixing). 

We'll be looking at Vagrant for local virtualization from a developer's POV discussing the reasons to use virtualization and comparing virtualization to containers. As developers, we can no longer expect Ops to take our application and make it work; we're responsible for knowing and understanding the integration points between our app and the underlying systems it runs upon. Having a defined environment that is consistent between development, staging and production is crucial to successful system deployment, and automating the configuration of that environment makes for simple & quick deployments to production (dare I say Continuous Integration?)

This Introduction to Vagrant will:

   * cover the concepts and nomenclature of Vagrant
   * demonstrate installation and management of Vagrant boxes
   * discuss the benefits of system configuration automation
   * compare / contrast containers to virtualization
   * demonstrate provisioning Vagrant with Chef
